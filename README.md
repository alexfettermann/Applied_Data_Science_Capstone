> *For this Lab I found a problem running cell of Task 6 and 7. The Task 6 it took more than 4 hours running. I tried several solutions, including the one provided by the staff, none of them worked. Anyway, I've left the line of code that was supposed to run.
You can verify that many others had the same issue
